Getting an OmniStudio enabled org
=================================

It's important to ensure you have an up to date Omnistudio environment to develop in.
Depending on your situation you:

* have access to a sandbox that's created from a production org that has Omnistudio installed,
* have the ability to create a scratch org that has Omnistudio enabled,
* not have access to a production org that has Omnistudio installed.

There are multiple options where you can sign up for a free trial org that has Omnistudio installed:

1. `Financial Services Cloud <https://developer.salesforce.com/free-trials/comparison/financial-services-cloud>`_ *recommended*
    * Always have an up to date Omnistudio installed at the time of sign up.
    * Two options are available
        * Base org
        * Learning org
2. `Industries Training Playground <https://vlocitytrial-prod.herokuapp.com/?templateid=SFI_IPQ>`_
    * Has Vlocity Omnistudio installed.
3. `Approval Process for Public Sector Solutions Org <https://trailhead.salesforce.com/promo/orgs/approval-process-for-public-sector-solutions>`_
    * Outdated Omnistudio version installed

These orgs are valid for 30 days.
Sign up for another org when your trial period ends to continue your development.
