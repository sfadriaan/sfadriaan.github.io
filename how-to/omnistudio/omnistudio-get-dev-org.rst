Getting an OmniStudio Enabled Org
=================================

It is important to ensure you have an up to date Omnistudio environment to develop in.
Depending on your situation you will:

* have access to a sandbox that is created from a production org that has Omnistudio installed,
* have the ability to create a scratch org that has Omnistudio enabled,
* not have access to a production org that has Omnistudio installed.

There are multiple options where you can sign up for a free trial org that has Omnistudio installed:

1. `Financial Services Cloud <https://developer.salesforce.com/free-trials/comparison/financial-services-cloud>`_ (*recommended*)
    * Always have an up to date Omnistudio installed at the time of sign up.
    * Two options are available (Learning org vs Base org)
2. `Industries Training Playground <https://vlocitytrial-prod.herokuapp.com/?templateid=SFI_IPQ>`_
    * Has Vlocity Omnistudio installed.
3. `Approval Process for Public Sector Solutions Org <https://trailhead.salesforce.com/promo/orgs/approval-process-for-public-sector-solutions>`_
    * Outdated Omnistudio version installed

These orgs are valid for 30 days (most of the times).
You will have to sign up for another org when your trial period ends to continue your development.
