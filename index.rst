Hi there ðŸ‘‹
===========

This blog is where I jot down everything and anything I encounter with Salesforce. 
This can include:

* aspects that I encountered (and struggled with) while using Salesforce, 
* or interesting questions I answered on Salesforce Stack Exchange.

The goal of this blog is to ensure you are able to learn from my, and other's, struggles, because ultimately:

   Learn from other people's mistakes. Life is too short to make them all yourself.
