==================

This blog is where I jot down everything and anything I encounter with Salesforce. 
This can include:

* aspects that I encountered (and struggled with) while using Salesforce, 
* or interesting questions I answered on Salesforce Stack Exchange.

The majority of the content is broken up in four sections:

..  grid:: 1 1 2 2

   ..  grid-item:: :doc:`Tutorials <tutorials/index>`

       **Start here** - hands-on introductions to the different Salesforce environments

   ..  grid-item:: :doc:`How-to guides <how-to/index>`

      **How-to guides** - step-by-step guides covering key aspects of Salesforce

.. grid:: 1 1 2 2
   :reverse:

   .. grid-item:: :doc:`Reference <reference/index>`

      **Technical information** - specifications, APIs, architecture

   .. grid-item:: :doc:`Explanation <explanation/index>`

      **Discussion and clarification** of key topics

The goal of this blog is to ensure you are able to learn from my (and other's) struggles, because ultimately:

   Learn from other people's mistakes. Life is too short to make them all yourself.
